    <h1><u>Arbitrage Trading </u></h1>

    <p style="font-size: 25px;font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><b>Arbitrage describes the act of buying a security in one market and simultaneously selling it in another market at a higher price, thereby enabling investors to profit from the temporary difference in cost per share. The arbitrage strategy can be used in many markets, including those for trading stocks and those for currency trading.
        In the stock market, traders exploit arbitrage opportunities by purchasing a stock on a foreign exchange where the equity's share price has not yet adjusted for the exchange rate, which is in a constant state of flux. The price of the stock on the foreign exchange is therefore undervalued compared to the price on the local exchange. This difference positions the trader to harvest gains from this differential.</b></p>
